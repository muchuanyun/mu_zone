title: Gain power from the failure

Recently I had an online code test for the first time. The result should be not very pleasant as I found an error just before the deadline and failed to correct it at the end (I used a common data type without fully consideration). It frustrated me a lot as I practice so many times and I really understand the overflow problem. Anyway, failure is failure. The lesson I learned is always keeping cautious with data type.
