After less than two days, I am going to leave my home again. To be honest, I enjoyed the time at home, though with guilty.

I have to say that the comfort makes me weak and cowardly. I am still the little girl who was standing behind the parents and felt afraid of outside world. It is hard to believe a person from such a poor family is such naive when facing the life. Not sure it is because of the length of the school time, or it is my personality.

But I have to move on. There is no excuse to escape from the storm.
